// A Metric is a category of Events that a user logs to Cobalt.

// A Metric belongs to a Project and has a name and a type.

// specified and the Event then belongs to that Metric.
//
// A MetricDefinition includes a list of ReportDefinitions. These are the
// definitions of the Reports that should be run for that Metric. Generating a
// Report involves the Cobalt client sending Observations to the server based
// on the Events belonging to the Metric, and the server performing an analysis
// of those Observations in order to generate the Report output.
//
// When an Observation is sent from a Cobalt client to the server, it contains
// a Metric id and a Report id. This indicates that the
// Observation is derived from the Events belonging to the Metric for the
// purpose of generating the Report.
//
// A MetricDefinition is used to define a Metric.
