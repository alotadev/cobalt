// The EventAggregator manages an in-memory store of aggregated Event values,
// indexed by report, day index, and other dimensions specific to the report
// type (e.g. event code). Periodically, this data is used to generate
// Observations representing aggregates of Event values over a day, week, month,
// etc.
//
// Each Logger interacts with the EventAggregator in the following way:
// (1) When the Logger is created, it calls UpdateAggregationConfigs() to
// provide the EventAggregator with its view of Cobalt's metric and report
// registry.
// (2) When logging an Event for a locally aggregated report, a Logger
// calls an Update*Aggregation() method with the Event and the
// ReportAggregationKey of the report.
//
// A worker thread does the following tasks at intervals specified in the
// EventAggregator's constructor:
// (1) Backs up the EventAggregator's state to the file system.
// (2) Calls GenerateObservations() with the previous day's day index to
// generate all Observations for rolling windows ending on that day index,
// as well as any missing Observations for a specified number of days in the
// past.
// (3) Calls GarbageCollect() to delete daily aggregates which are not
// needed to compute aggregates for any windows of interest in the future.
