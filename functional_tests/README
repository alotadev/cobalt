Please put functional, end-to-end, integration tests here.  These should be
tests that stand up complete components (without mocks), treat them as black
boxes, and test them based on inputs and outputs.

Functional tests are currently being run as part of cobaltb.py test.

Unit tests should still live in the directories of individual components.
