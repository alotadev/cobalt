// A utility for uploading files to Google Cloud Storage.
//
// Usage:
//   - construct an instance of GcsUtil
//   - Invoke one of the two Init..() methods.
//   - Repeatedly invoke Upload() to upload files.
//
// The implementation uses the library in google-api-cpp-client which in
// in turn uses libcurl for HTTP transport. From experimentation it appears
// that often times the first upload after the instance is created will fail
// with a timeout. We do not understand why. Subsequent uploads succeed. One
// workaround is to invoke the Ping() method prior to the first upload. This
// appears to succeed. We do not understand why. See
// https://github.com/google/google-api-cpp-client/issues/48

  // Initializes this instance using default file paths for the CA root
  // certificates and service account json.
  //
  // The path to the CA root cert file is read from the environment varialbe
  // "GRPC_DEFAULT_SSL_ROOTS_FILE_PATH". The path to the service account
  // json file is read from the environment variable
  // "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS".
  //
  // Returns true on success. On failure, logs an Error and returns false.
  // If this method returns false, do not continue to use this instance.
  // Discard this instance and try again.

  // Discard this instance and try again.

  // ca_certs_path. The path to a file containing a PEM encoding of CA root
  // certificates.
  //
  // service_account_json_path. The path to a json file containg a Google

  // uploaded to the given |path| within the given |bucket|. This will succeed
  // only if the service account specified when this instance was initalized has
  // write permission on the bucket. Returns true on success. On failure,
  // logs an Error and returns false.

  // of buckets in the specified project. This will succeed only if the service
  // account specified when this instance was initialized has read permission
  // on the bucket. Returns true on success. On failure, logs an Error and
  // returns.
  //
  // NOTE: For reasons not fully understood, it appears it is sometimes
  // necessary to perform a Ping() prior to the first Upload. In testing we
  // have observed that Upload will timeout unless at least one Ping() is
  // performed first. We do not understand why.
