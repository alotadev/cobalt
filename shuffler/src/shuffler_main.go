/*
Package implementing a simple gRPC server that performs unary RPC to
implement shuffler service whose definition can be found in
shuffler/service/shuffler.proto.

A shuffler listens to incoming requests from Encoders (end users),
strips the user metadata like IP-address, timestamps etc before buffering
them locally based on the manifest information provided in the request.
