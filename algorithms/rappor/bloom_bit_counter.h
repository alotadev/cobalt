// - Construct a BloomBitCounter
// - Invoke AddObservation() many times to add all of the observations.
// - Invoke EstimateCounts() to retrieve the raw bit sums, estimated counts
//   and std errors for each bit position of each cohort.
// - The accesors num_observations() and observation_errors() may be used to
//   discover the number of times AddObservation() was invoked successfully
//   and unsuccessfully.
