// ShippingManager is a central coordinator for collecting encoded Observations
// and sending them to the Shuffler. Observations are accumulated in memory
// and periodically sent in batches to the Shuffler by a background worker
// thread on a regular schedule. ShippingManager also performs expedited
// off-schedule sends when too much unsent Observation data has accumulated.
// A client may also explicitly request an expedited send.
//
// ShippingManager uses a SendRetryer to send Observations to the Shuffler so
// in case a send fails it will be retried multiple times with exponential
// back-off.
//
// ShippingManager uses gRPC to send to the Shuffler. The unit of data sent
// in a single gRPC request is the *Envelope*. ShippingManager will distribute
// the collection of Observations it controls into one or more Envelopes
// in order to try to achieve an efficient size Envelope to send.
//
// Usage: Construct a ShippingManager, invoke Start() once, and repeatedly
// invoke AddObservation(). After Start() has been invoked calls to
// AddObservation() are thread safe: It may be invoked concurrently
// by multiple threads. Optionally invoke RequestSendSoon() to expedite a send
// operation.
//
// Usually a single ShippingManager will be constructed for an entire
// client device and all applications running on that device that wish to use
// Cobalt to collect metrics will make use of this single instance.
