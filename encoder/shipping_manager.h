// ShippingManager is a central coordinator for collecting encoded Observations
// and sending them to the Shuffler. Observations are accumulated in the
// ObservationStore and periodically sent in batches to the Shuffler by a
// background worker thread on a regular schedule. ShippingManager also performs
// expedited off-schedule sends when too much unsent Observation data has
// accumulated.  A client may also explicitly request an expedited send.
//
// ShippingManager is used to upload data to a Shuffler. The unit of data sent
// in a single request is the *Envelope*. ShippingManager will get Envelopes
// from the ObservationStore, and attempt to send them.
//
// Usage: Construct a ShippingManager, invoke Start() once. Whenever an
// observation is added to the ObservationStore, call NotifyObservationsAdded()
// which allows ShippingManager to check if it needs to send early. Optionally
// invoke RequestSendSoon() to expedite a send operation.
//
// Usually a single ShippingManager will be constructed for each shuffler
// backend the client device wants to send to. All applications running on that
// device use the same set of ShippingManagers.
