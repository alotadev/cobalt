  // Uses the wrapped ShufflerClient to send the given |encrypted_message| to
  // the Shuffler. It should be an encrypted Envelope as given by the output of
  // EnvelopeMaker::MakeEncryptedEnvelope().
  //
  // |inital_rpc_deadline| is the gRPC deadline to use for the first send
  // attempt. This must be positive or we will CHECK fail. The deadline will be
  // increased in later attempts if a DEADLINE_EXCEEDED status code is returned
  // from the Shuffler. We will not honor arbitrarily large values of this
  // parameter: We will truncate to a reasonable upper bound for all
  // RPC timeouts.
  //
  // |overall_deadline| is the overall deadline granted to the Retryer for its
  // multiple attempts to send. This  must be >= |initial_rpc_deadline| or
  // we will CHECK fail. This may be set to std::chrono::seconds:max()
  // and the Retryer will retry "forever". Normally this should not be set
  // to less than about a minute in order to give the Retryer enough time
  // to try multiple times with increasing timeouts.
  //
  // |cancel_handle|. An optional pointer to an object that allows for
  // cancellation. This may be NULL but if it is not NULL then it must remain
  // valid for the duration of the call. Does not take ownership of
  // |cancel_handle|.
  //
  // This is a synchronous method that may take a long time to return
  // as the Retryer performs multiple attempts to send with exponential
  // backoff. This method will return when one of the following occurs:
  //
  // - A successful send. Returns OK.
  //
  // - A non-retryable status code is received from the shuffler. Returns
  //   that status code.
  //
  // - |overall_deadline| has been exceeded. Returns DEADLINE_EXCEEDED.
  //
  // - TryCancel() is invoked (from some other thread) on the provided
  //   |cancel_handle|. May return CANCELLED in this case if the call
  //   was successfully canceled. Other responses including OK are possible
  //   after a TryCancel() because the cancellation is not guaranteed.
